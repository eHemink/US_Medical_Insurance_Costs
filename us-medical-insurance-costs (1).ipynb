    "- Insurance costs for people who smoke are significantly higher than the costs of those who don't smoke. The difference in average insurance costs between non-smokers and smokers is 23615.96 dollars.\n",

    "- Smoking status and BMI don't provide information about each other. However, the highest bin of the BMI scale (which includes individuals with a BMI between 45.0 and 55.0) has the highest proportion of smokers, at 25%. The percentage of smokers in the other three bins varies between 19.1% and 22.3%.\n",
